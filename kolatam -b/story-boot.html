      my instructor. I had a lot of fun when I did it and it helped me relax. It was a lot
      of fun. Lots of kind people helped me along the way. One time when I had my kolatam competion it rained so everyone had to go home and it was scheduled for the next day. Eveyone had to hide under the stage. The competion was also very late. My dad`s cousin helped me alot and my friend Vishnu. Here is one picture of me and Vishnu doing kolatam together:<br> <img src="pic.jpg"> <br> Duiring my competion I had to wear a kanduva. Girls had to wear a chunni. Inside the temple some girls on my kolatam team were doing a special dance called bhareathanatyam. Here they are: <br> <img src="pic3.jpg"> <br> Kolatam was the best experience of my life.   </p>
